# REDUX


## Why We Need REDUX?
    
    A. COMPONENT STATE ISSUES (No REDUX)
        * Complex States are complex
        * Components Really aren't reusable
        * Have to pass props through all components to become accessible


    B. Able to use components anywhere
        * Individual components communicate with the store 
        * Instead of with each other
        * Each component does not need a new version of actions to do the same thing as other components
        * Each component only needs two things 
           1 What data it needs
           2 What data it needs to change
